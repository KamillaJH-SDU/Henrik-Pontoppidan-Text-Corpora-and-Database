# Henrik-Pontoppidan-Text-Corpora-and-Database
## Project description
The project was funded by The Carlsberg Foundation, Research Infrastructure grant 2021-2024.
The aim of the project was to register all of the material regarding the Danish author Henrik Pontoppidan collected by Thorklid and Esther Skjerbæk. The archive is located in physical form at the University Library of Southern Denmark and the project's main focus was to make this collection available to the public. The collection was registrered by three student assistants, first in EndNote and later exported to Zotero, as Zotero's group library function made it easier to make the data publicly available. The Zotero library can be found here: https://www.zotero.org/groups/5208788/skjerbk/library and it will be updated every six months (February and August) with new publications (in the folder "Newer_publications"). The full dataset of the Skjerbæk archive can be found in the Zotero Group Library folder "Skjerbæk_full", and it is also to be found in Zenodo: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.12684024.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12684024) 
The dataset does not include full text versions of the publications due to copyright issues, but most of the publications can be found online either on www.henrikpontoppidan.dk or through Danish libraries. 
One of the analyses connected to the project is an examination of how the secondary literature on Henrik Pontoppidan is distributed through the years, and how it is connected. The last part is done through a kind of citation analysis, and the dataset for this analysis will be made public on Zenodo in the fall of 2024, as well as the code for doing the analysis, which will be added on this GitHub page. 
A later part of the project will be to make raw versions of the works of Henrik Pontoppidan available as well, including the different versions of the novels. 
One publication has already been published, in which we compare five different versions of the same short story in order to see how the expressions change as the short story is revised: Vlachos, E., & Husen, K. J. (2023). Revisiting Pontoppidan: Sentiment analysis and topic modelling on ‘Eagle's Flight’. Orbis Litterarum, 78, 441–463. https://doi.org/10.1111/oli.12406
